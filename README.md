# OSFE_CustomCharacterLootRemover
Allows custom characters to specify if they want the 2 types of loot to appear as rewards. Also allows disabling the shop.

To remove Spells add <SkipSpellRewards></SkipSpellRewards> to character loadout.
To remove Artifacts add <SkipArtifactRewards></SkipArtifactRewards> to character loadout.
To disable shop add <DisableShop></DisableShop> to character loadout.

Only works in the mods folder right now, as that folder has priority.
